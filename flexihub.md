## Software as a service for accessing USB devices connected to remote computers over the Internet

[FlexiHub](https://www.flexihub.com/about-us/) is a software as a service for redirecting all types of USB devices over the network and accessing remote USB devices over the Internet. It is a subdivision of Electronic Team, Inc. and has remained the flagship product since it was presented in 2014.

FlexiHub is a convenient software service for individuals, small teams, and major organizations that supports all of the key connection protocols:

- TCP/IP
- UDP
- RDP

*FlexiHub is a driverless solution—it does not require any device drivers installed on the local computer, i.e. the device type is detected automatically when connected to remote machines.*

**FlexiHub is a cross-platform service that is capable of connecting USB devices between different operating systems:**

- Windows;
- macOS;
- Linux;
- Android;
- Raspberry Pi.

Also, FlexiHub can be used to redirect COM ports over Ethernet (supported only by the Windows version).

FlexiHub uses 2048-bit SSL encryption to protect traffic, has Login tokens for safe account sharing, and auto-connect feature. Also, it offers optional data compression and the Private Tunnel Server to maximize your connection speed.

To minimize any possible downtimes, FlexiHub features the “Keep connection alive” & “Auto-connect” built-in options to make USB device sharing as reliable as possible.

FlexiHub is distributed via a subscription-based model. There are 4 different grades of subscriptions:

- An annually billed Personal plan for individual users (starts at $14/month);
- A monthly-billed Team subscription for professional teams (starts at $12/month/user);
- A pay-as-you-go Business subscription customized to fit specific business needs (starts at $50/100 sessions*);
- A custom Enterprise subscription for enterprise-level projects (price available upon request).

>1 session = 1 connection to a remote device.

FlexiHub comes with a demo subscription during which you can test the service for free within 30 days with 5 sessions available.
